The main theoretical contribution is to show that for any model belonging to that class, the coefficients on the terms linear and quadratic in the state vector in a second-order expansion of the decision rule are independent of the volatility of the exogenous shocks. In addition, the paper presents a set of MATLAB programs that implement the proposed second-order approximation method and applies it to a number of model economies.},

	Abstract = { Although the terminology of Big Data has so far gained little traction in economics, the availability of unprecedentedly rich datasets and the need for new approaches {\^a} both epistemological and computational {\^a} to deal with them is an emerging issue for the discipline. Using interviews conducted with a cross-section of economists, this paper examines perspectives on Big Data across the discipline, the new types of data being used by researchers on economic issues, and the range of responses to this opportunity amongst economists. First, we outline the areas in which it is being used, including the prediction and {\^a}nowcasting{\^a} of economic trends; mapping and predicting influence in the context of marketing; and acting as a cheaper or more accurate substitute for existing types of data such as censuses or labour market data. We then analyse the broader current and potential contributions of Big Data to economics, such as the ways in which econometric methodology is being used to shed light on questions beyond economics, how Big Data is improving or changing economic models, and the kinds of collaborations arising around Big Data between economists and other disciplines. },

@article{Einav1243089,
	Abstract = {Background Economic science has evolved over several decades toward greater emphasis on empirical work. The data revolution of the past decade is likely to have a further and profound effect on economic research. Increasingly, economists make use of newly available large-scale administrative data or private sector data that often are obtained through collaborations with private firms, giving rise to new opportunities and challenges. The rising use of non{\textendash}publicly available data in economic research. Here we show the percentage of papers published in the American Economic Review (AER) that obtained an exemption from the AER{\textquoteright}s data availability policy, as a share of all papers published by the AER that relied on any form of data (excluding simulations and laboratory experiments). Notes and comments, as well as AER Papers and Proceedings issues, are not included in the analysis. We obtained a record of exemptions directly from the AER administrative staff and coded each exemption manually to reflect public sector versus private data. Our check of nonexempt papers suggests that the AER records may possibly understate the percentage of papers that actually obtained exemptions. The asterisk indicates that data run from when the AER started collecting these data (December 2005 issue) to the September 2014 issue. To make full use of the data, we define year 2006 to cover October 2005 through September 2006, year 2007 to cover October 2006 through September 2007, and so on. Advances These new data are affecting economic research along several dimensions. Many fields have shifted from a reliance on relatively small-sample government surveys to administrative data with universal or near-universal population coverage. This shift is transformative, as it allows researchers to rigorously examine variation in wages, health, productivity, education, and other measures across different subpopulations; construct consistent long-run statistical indices; generate new quasi-experimental research designs; and track diverse outcomes from natural and controlled experiments. Perhaps even more notable is the expansion of private sector data on economic activity. These data, sometimes available from public sources but other times obtained through data-sharing agreements with private firms, can help to create more granular and real-time measurement of aggregate economic statistics. The data also offer researchers a look inside the {\textquotedblleft}black box{\textquotedblright} of firms and markets by providing meaningful statistics on economic behavior such as search and information gathering, communication, decision-making, and microlevel transactions. Collaborations with data-oriented firms also create new opportunities to conduct and evaluate randomized experiments. Economic theory plays an important role in the analysis of large data sets with complex structure. It can be difficult to organize and study this type of data (or even to decide which variables to construct) without a simplifying conceptual framework, which is where economic models become useful. Better data also allow for sharper tests of existing models and tests of theories that had previously been difficult to assess. Outlook The advent of big data is already allowing for better measurement of economic effects and outcomes and is enabling novel research designs across a range of topics. Over time, these data are likely to affect the types of questions economists pose, by allowing for more focus on population variation and the analysis of a broader range of economic activities and interactions. We also expect economists to increasingly adopt the large-data statistical methods that have been developed in neighboring fields and that often may complement traditional econometric techniques. These data opportunities also raise some important challenges. Perhaps the primary one is developing methods for researchers to access and explore data in ways that respect privacy and confidentiality concerns. This is a major issue in working with both government administrative data and private sector firms. Other challenges include developing the appropriate data management and programming capabilities, as well as designing creative and scalable approaches to summarize, describe, and analyze large-scale and relatively unstructured data sets. These challenges notwithstanding, the next few decades are likely to be a very exciting time for economic research. The quality and quantity of data on economic activity are expanding rapidly. Empirical research increasingly relies on newly available large-scale administrative data or private sector data that often is obtained through collaboration with private firms. Here we highlight some challenges in accessing and using these new data. We also discuss how new data sets may change the statistical methods used by economists and the types of questions posed in empirical research.},

	Abstract = { Decisions in service operations are complex since they involve various interdependent decision-makers (agents) at different hierarchical levels, ranging from customer representatives over account managers to top executives. We formulate a three-level maintenance service problem as a stochastic decision-making model, with an account manager, supervisor, and worker at each of the three levels. The proposed incentive mechanism aligns the interests of lower level agents with the goals of the top agent. The agents' strategic interactions are analyzed game-theoretically and results show that a Pareto-efficient Nash equilibrium can be attained given certain organizational properties. Furthermore, we show that local information can be sufficient for organization-wide optimal decisions. In a final step, the three-level model is generalized for multi-level, i.e., multi-organizational-scale, systems.

	Abstract = {Decision-making in organizations is complex due to interdependencies among decision-makers (agents) within and across organizational hierarchies. We propose a multiscale decision-making model that captures and analyzes multiscale agent interactions in large, distributed decision-making systems. In general, multiscale systems exhibit phenomena that are coupled through various temporal, spatial and organizational scales. Our model focuses on the organizational scale and provides analytic, closed-form solutions which enable agents across all organizational scales to select a best course of action. By setting an optimal intensity level for agent interactions, an organizational designer can align the choices of self-interested agents with the overall goals of the organization. Moreover, our results demonstrate when local and aggregate information exchange is sufficient for system-wide optimal decision-making. We motivate the model and illustrate its capabilities using a manufacturing enterprise example.},

	Abstract = {Decisions in manufacturing planning environments involve various interdependent hierarchical levels, ranging from shop-floor operations over production planning to enterprise coordination. Distributed decision making across these hierarchies reduces the complexity compared to an otherwise monolithic planning approach. We develop a stochastic model with two decision makers (agents) and analyze their strategic interaction using game theory. The mutual influence between agents depends on organizational parameters, which, in a first case, agents themselves can regulate, and, in a second case, an organizational designer can control. The model provides managerial insights on how to achieve cooperation among self-interested agents and how decisions and preferences of agents can be aligned with the goals of the organization. Moreover, we investigate the degree and fidelity of information necessary for optimal decision making. The model is applied to a manufacturing enterprise context.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a framework for formation stabilization of multiple autonomous vehicles in a distributed fashion. Each vehicle is assumed to have simple dynamics, i.e. a double-integrator, with a directed (or an undirected) information flow over the formation graph of the vehicles. Our goal is to find a distributed control law (with an efficient computational cost) for each vehicle that makes use of limited information regarding the state of other vehicles. Here, the key idea in formation stabilization is the use of natural potential functions obtained from structural constraints of a desired formation in a way that leads to a collision-free, distributed, and bounded state feedback law for each vehicle.},

	Abstract = {A cryptocurrency token offers a method of incentivizing behavior in a way that supports trusted interaction (through its blockchain-based infrastructure). It also acts as a multipurpose instrument that may fulfill a variety of roles, such as facilitating digital use cases or acting as a store of value. Understanding how to value such an instrument is complicated by these multiple roles because the relative valuation of one role cannot be disentangled from another role---a token is a `bundled' good. In this work a general pricing model for cryptocurrency tokens is derived, based upon and extending the hedonic pricing framework of Rosen (J Polit Econ 82(1):34--55, https://doi.org/10.1086/260169, 1974) in a partial equilibrium framework. It is shown that individual roles (or characteristics) of a token may be priced by inverting in a special way the relationship between the token's aggregate quantity and its provision of characteristics. Interaction between a monopolistic token seller and a representative buyer results in an equilibrium that clears both the aggregate token market and the characteristic market. Particular attention is given to the case in which a token possesses a security role, as this has been a focus of existing discussions regarding the regulation of the cryptocurrency market.},

	Abstract = {In cyber-physical systems like automotive systems, there are components like sensors, actuators, and controllers that communicate asynchronously with each other. The computational model of actor supports modeling distributed asynchronously communicating systems. We propose Hybrid Rebeca language to support modeling of cyber-physical systems. Hybrid Rebeca is an extension of actor-based language Rebeca. In this extension, physical actors are introduced as new computational entities to encapsulate physical behaviors. To support various means of communication among the entities, the network is explicitly modeled as a separate entity from actors. We derive hybrid automata as the basis for analysis of Hybrid Rebeca models. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through a case study in the domain of automotive systems. We use SpaceEx framework for the analysis of the case study.},

	Abstract = {Repeated communication in networks is often considered to impose large information requirements on individuals, and for that reason, the literature has resorted to use heuristics, such as DeGroot's, to compute how individuals update beliefs. In this paper we propose a new heuristic which we term the Bayesian Peer Influence (BPI) heuristic. The BPI accords with Bayesian updating for all (conditionally) independent information structures. More generally, the BPI can be used to analyze the effects of correlation neglect on communication in networks. We analyze the evolution of beliefs and show that the limit is a simple extension of the BPI and parameters of the network structure. We also show that consensus in society might change dynamically, and that beliefs might become polarised. These results contrast with those obtained in papers that have used the DeGroot heuristic.},

	Abstract = {We develop a dynamic model of opinion formation in social networks when the information required for learning a parameter may not be at the disposal of any single agent. Individuals engage in communication with their neighbors in order to learn from their experiences. However, instead of incorporating the views of their neighbors in a fully Bayesian manner, agents use a simple updating rule which linearly combines their personal experience and the views of their neighbors. We show that, as long as individuals take their personal signals into account in a Bayesian way, repeated interactions lead them to successfully aggregate information and learn the true parameter. This result holds in spite of the apparent na{\"\i}vet{\'e} of agentsʼ updating rule, the agentsʼ need for information from sources the existence of which they may not be aware of, worst prior views, and the assumption that no agent can tell whether her own views or those of her neighbors are more accurate.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues that, in the presence of intersectoral input--output linkages, microeconomic idiosyncratic shocks may lead to aggregate fluctuations. We show that, as the economy becomes more disaggregated, the rate at which aggregate volatility decays is determined by the structure of the network capturing such linkages. Our main results provide a characterization of this relationship in terms of the importance of different sectors as suppliers to their immediate customers, as well as their role as indirect suppliers to chains of downstream sectors. Such higher-order interconnections capture the possibility of ``cascade effects'' whereby productivity shocks to a sector propagate not only to its immediate downstream customers, but also to the rest of the economy. Our results highlight that sizable aggregate volatility is obtained from sectoral idiosyncratic shocks only if there exists significant asymmetry in the roles that sectors play as suppliers to others, and that the ``sparseness'' of the input--output matrix is unrelated to the nature of aggregate fluctuations.},

First, a brief introduction to system-of-systems is presented in order to establish a foundation for exploration of the role of human system modeling in this context. Second, the sources of complexity related to human participation in a system-of-systems are described and categorized. Finally, special attention is placed upon how this complexity might be better managed by greater involvement of modeling of human behavior and decision-making. The ultimate objective of the research thrust is to better enable success in the various system-of-systems that exist in society.},

@article{Tien2008,
	Abstract = {The services sector employs a large and growing proportion of workers in the industrialized nations, and it is increasingly dependent on information and communication technologies. While the interdependences, similarities and complementarities of manufacturing and services are significant, there are considerable differences between goods and services, including the shift in focus from mass production to mass customization (whereby a service is produced and delivered in response to a customer's stated or imputed needs). In general, services can be considered to be knowledge-intensive agents or components which work together as providers and consumers to create or co-produce value. Like manufacturing systems, an efficient service system must be an integrated system of systems, leading to greater connectivity and interdependence. Integration must occur over the physical, temporal, organizational and functional dimensions, and must include methods concerned with the component, the management, and the system. Moreover, an effective service system must also be an adaptable system, leading to greater value and responsiveness. Adaptation must occur over the dimensions of monitoring, feedback, cybernetics and learning, and must include methods concerned with space, time, and system. In sum, service systems are indeed complex, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the human-centered aspects of such systems. Moreover, the system complexities can only be dealt with methods that enhance system integration and adaptation. The paper concludes with several insights, including a plea to shift the current misplaced focus on developing a science or discipline for services to further developing a systems engineering approach to services, an approach based on the integration and adaptation of a host of sciences or disciplines (e.g., physics, mathematics, statistics, psychology, sociology, etc.). In fact, what is required is a services-related transdisciplinary - beyond a single disciplinary - ontology or taxonomy as a basis for disciplinary integration and adaptation.},
